# Simple CO2 Emission Analytics Table

"Heroku marked free databases for deletion. As of November 28th, 2022, free Heroku Postgres and Heroku Data for RedisÂ® plans are no longer available. If Heroku deleted your free database and you want to recover your data, contact Support as soon as possible."

Until I find another free hosting service I can only try presenting the projects locally.
